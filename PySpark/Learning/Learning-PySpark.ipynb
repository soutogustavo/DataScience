    "Spark is a general-purpose, distributed programming framework that was developed at the AMPLab at the University of California, Berkeley. It is open source software that provides an in-memory computation framework and it is also good for batch processing. Spark works well with real-time (or, better to say, near-real-time) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning and graph algorithms are iterative. Where Spark do magic. According to its research paper, it is approximately 100 times faster than its peer, Hadoop. Data can be cached in memory. Caching intermediate data in iterative algorithms provides amazingly fast processing speed. Spark can be programmed with Java, Scala, Python, and R."
